A collection of C (C11) data structures to store integers, strings, pointers,
structs.

All data structures can live (temporarily) on the stack, or permanently in the
heap. None of them are thread-safe.
[mulle-allocator](//github.com/mulle-c/mulle-allocator) is used pervasively to
simplify memory management.
Some data structures utilize callbacks that are compatible to OS X's
[`NSHashtable`](//nshipster.com/nshashtable-and-nsmaptable/) and friends.
