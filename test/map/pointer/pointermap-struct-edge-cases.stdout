Testing pointermap-struct edge cases and boundary conditions
Test 1: Empty/uninitialized objects
  Empty map count: 0
  Get from empty map: NULL
Test 2: Boundary conditions
  Map with capacity 1 - initial size: 4
  Added item, count: 1
  Added second item, count: 2
Test 3: Invalid parameters
  Large capacity map size: 2097152
Test 4: Memory allocation failures
  Large map created: success
Test 5: Basic operations
  Added 3 items
    Retrieved: key1 -> id=1, name=one, value=1.1
    Retrieved: key2 -> id=2, name=two, value=2.2
    Retrieved: key3 -> id=3, name=three, value=3.3
  Missing key result: NULL
Test 6: Remove operations
  Before remove, count: 1
  Remove result: 1
  After remove, count: 0
  Remove non-existent result: 0
Test 7: Enumeration
  Enumerating map items:
  Map has 3 items
Test 8: Reset operations
  Before reset, count: 3
  After reset, count: 0
Test 9: Copy operations
  Source map count: 2
  Copied map count: 2
    Verified copy: copy_key1 -> id=100
    Verified copy: copy_key2 -> id=200
Test 10: Shrink operations
  Before shrink, size: 128
  After shrink, size: 4
