Testing structarray comprehensive coverage
Testing structarray basic operations
Initial array - count: 0, size: 4
Element size: 48
After adding 3 items - count: 3
Retrieved item at index 0: id=1, name=first, value=1.1
Retrieved item at index 2: id=3, name=third, value=3.3
First item: id=1, name=first, value=1.1
Last item: id=3, name=third, value=3.3
Testing structarray pop and set operations
Initial count: 3
Popped item: id=30, name=thirty, value=30.0
Count after pop: 2
After set at index 1: id=99, name=ninety-nine, value=99.9
Pop from empty array: failed (expected)
Testing structarray insert and remove operations
Initial count: 2
After insert at index 1 - count: 3
Item 0: id=1, name=first, value=1.0
Item 1: id=2, name=second, value=2.0
Item 2: id=3, name=third, value=3.0
After remove at index 1 - count: 2
After remove last - count: 1
Testing structarray guarantee and reserve operations
Initial size: 2
Guarantee succeeded
Size after guarantee: 10
Added guaranteed item, count: 1
Reserved and wrote item directly, count: 2
Advanced by 2, count: 4
Testing structarray with static storage
Initialized with static storage, size: 0
Count after adding 2 items: 2
Retrieved from static storage: id=1, name=static1, value=1.0
Testing structarray sorting operations
Before sorting (count 5):
  Item 0: id=30, name=thirty
  Item 1: id=10, name=ten
  Item 2: id=50, name=fifty
  Item 3: id=20, name=twenty
  Item 4: id=40, name=forty
After sorting:
  Item 0: id=10, name=ten
  Item 1: id=20, name=twenty
  Item 2: id=30, name=thirty
  Item 3: id=40, name=forty
  Item 4: id=50, name=fifty
Testing structarray edge cases
Get first from empty array: NULL (expected)
Get last from empty array: NULL (expected)
Get lenient from empty array: found
Get lenient at valid index 0: found
Get lenient at invalid index 10: NULL (expected)
Get current pointer: found
Used as length: 48
Size as length: 48
Testing structarray zero and count operations
Initial count: 2
Count after zero_to_count(5): 5
Count after set_count(3): 3 (returned: 0)
Size after size_to_fit: 3
All structarray coverage tests completed
