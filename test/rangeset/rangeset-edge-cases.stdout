Testing rangeset edge cases and boundary conditions
Test 1: NULL parameter handling
  NULL set parameter: no crash
  NULL range parameter: no crash
Test 2: Empty/uninitialized objects
  Empty set count: 0
  Added to empty set, count: 1
Test 3: Boundary conditions
  Zero-length range added, count: 0
  Large range added, count: 1
  Adjacent ranges added, count: 2
Test 4: Invalid ranges
  Invalid range (end < start) handled
  Large unsigned range handled
Test 5: Overlapping ranges
  Overlapping ranges merged, count: 1
  Final ranges:
    Range: [10, 40)
Test 6: Search operations
  Range [15,25) contained: 0
  Range [15,25) intersects: 1
  Location 35 found in range: [30, 40)
Test 7: Remove operations
  Initial count: 3
  After remove [15,25), count: 3
  After remove non-existent, count: 3
Test 8: Memory allocation failures
  Large capacity set size: 1000000
Test 9: Shift operations
  After shift by 100:
    Range: [110, 120)
    Range: [130, 140)
    Range: [150, 160)
Test 10: Reset operations
  Before reset, count: 3
  After reset, count: 0
