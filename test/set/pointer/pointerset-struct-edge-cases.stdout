Testing pointerset-struct edge cases and boundary conditions
Test 1: NULL parameter handling
  NULL parameters handled by API
Test 2: Empty/uninitialized objects
  Empty set count: 0
  Get from empty set: NULL
Test 3: Boundary conditions
  Set with capacity 1 - initial size: 4
  Added item, count: 1
  Added duplicate, count: 1
Test 4: Invalid parameters
  Large capacity set size: 2097152
Test 5: Memory allocation failures
  Large set created: success
Test 6: Basic operations
  Added 3 items
    Retrieved: id=1, name=one, value=1.1
    Retrieved: id=2, name=two, value=2.2
    Retrieved: id=3, name=three, value=3.3
  Missing item result: NULL
Test 7: Remove operations
  Before remove, count: 1
  Remove result: 1
  After remove, count: 0
  Remove non-existent result: 0
Test 8: Enumeration
  Enumerating set items:
  Set has 3 items
Test 9: Reset operations
  Before reset, count: 3
  After reset, count: 0
Test 10: Copy operations
  Source set count: 2
  Copied set count: 2
    Verified copy: id=100
    Verified copy: id=200
Test 11: Membership testing
  Item 1 membership: 1
  Item 2 membership: 1
  Non-member membership: 0
